# Clustering-using-K-Means-Algorithm-to-Determine-Fraud-and-Non-Fraud
This project is a Mid-Semester Exam assignment for the Machine Learning course. In this project, I am working together with:
  - Zwita Agustina 235314180
  - Maria Petra Zeta 235314222
  - Divana Bunga 235314225

This project utilizes the K-Means algorithm for clustering and the PCA algorithm for dimensional reduction. The data processing in this project begins with data preprocessing (handling missing values, duplicate values, and outliers), followed by normalization, dimensional reduction, and clustering.
